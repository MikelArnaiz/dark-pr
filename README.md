# dark-pr

While reviewing a PR with [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) is quite difficult to see code additions and deletions.

This chrome plugin increases the contrast for `.blob-code-addition .x` and `.blob-code-deletion .x` elements

## How to install

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable _developer mode_ in the top right corner
3. _Load Unpacked_ in the top left corner and select the content of `src` of this repo
